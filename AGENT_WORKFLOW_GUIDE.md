**Version:** 1.0  
**Target Audience:** Claude, ChatGPT, and other AI development assistants  
**Project:** Echo Android Application  
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-04 22:47 UTC

**CRITICAL FOR AI AGENTS:** Always use `get_current_time({timezone: "UTC"})` MCP function for accurate timestamps in all documentation.

---

## üéØ ESSENTIAL READING - START HERE

### If this is your FIRST conversation or a NEW Claude session:

1. **Read this entire guide** (15-20 minutes) - DO NOT skip sections
2. **Read `AGENT_DOCUMENTATION.md`** completely - Current project state and change tracking
3. **Read `AGENT_SESSION_CHECKLIST.md`** - Your step-by-step workflow
4. **Follow the "New Session Startup" process below** - Every single time

### If you're continuing from a previous session in the SAME conversation:
- Skip to "Making Changes Workflow" section
- Still check current project state with `./gradlew clean`

---

## üöÄ NEW SESSION STARTUP PROCESS

### Phase 1: Orientation (10 minutes)

#### Step 1: Read Critical Documentation
```bash
# In this exact order:
1. Read AGENT_DOCUMENTATION.md (focus on "Current Status" and "Change Log")
2. Read AGENT_SESSION_CHECKLIST.md (your workflow template)
3. Skim documentation/echo-critical-fixes.md (understand major issues)
4. Check the "Next Agent Should Focus On" section in AGENT_DOCUMENTATION.md
```

#### Step 2: Assess Current Project State
```bash
# Run these commands to understand current state:
cd echo
./gradlew --version                    # Confirm environment
./gradlew clean                        # Should complete in ~20-30s
timeout 120s ./gradlew build          # May fail, document how/where
```

**Note: Use GitHub MCP server functions to read/write files when possible instead of manual file operations.**

#### Step 3: Update Documentation
- Open `AGENT_DOCUMENTATION.md`
- Update "Current Session Workspace" section:
  - Fill in "Today's Focus"
  - Note any changes in build behavior
  - Record your session start time

### Phase 2: Goal Selection (5 minutes)

#### Choose the SMALLEST Possible Goal
- Look at "Current Priority Goals" in `AGENT_DOCUMENTATION.md`
- Select the topmost goal that seems achievable in 1-2 hours
- Break it down further if it seems too large
- Write down EXACTLY what success looks like

#### Success Criteria Template:
```
Goal: [Specific thing to fix/improve]
Success Metric: [How you'll know it worked]
Test Plan: [How you'll verify it works]
Rollback Plan: [How to undo if it breaks things]
```

---

## üîß MAKING CHANGES WORKFLOW

### The Golden Rules:

1. **ONE CHANGE AT A TIME** - Never modify multiple unrelated things
2. **TEST IMMEDIATELY** - After each change, verify it works
3. **ROLLBACK ON FAILURE** - If something breaks, undo immediately
4. **DOCUMENT EVERYTHING** - Use the change log template
5. **USE MCP SERVER** - Always use GitHub MCP functions for Git operations

### Change Process:

#### Step 1: Pre-Change Documentation
```markdown
## Change [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] - [CHANGE_ID]

### Goal
- What specific problem this addresses
- Expected outcome

### Files Modified
- [List files you plan to change]

### Testing Plan
- How you'll verify this works
```

#### Step 2: Make ONE Small Change
- Edit one file or fix one specific issue
- Keep the change as minimal as possible
- Do NOT make multiple changes at once

#### Step 3: Test Immediately
```bash
# For build changes:
./gradlew clean build

# For specific module changes:
./gradlew :module-name:compileDebugUnitTestKotlin

# For test fixes:
./gradlew :module-name:test
```

#### Step 4: Document Results
Complete the change log entry:
```markdown
### Result
- ‚úÖ SUCCESS: What worked and why
- ‚ùå FAILED: What didn't work and why
- üü° PARTIAL: What partially worked

### Next Steps
- What should be done next
```

### What Counts as "One Change":
- ‚úÖ Add one missing dependency
- ‚úÖ Fix one compilation error
- ‚úÖ Resolve one import issue
- ‚úÖ Fix one failing test
- ‚ùå "Refactor the entire service layer"
- ‚ùå "Migrate to Jetpack Compose"
- ‚ùå "Fix all the threading issues"

## üèóÔ∏è ARCHITECTURAL CONTEXT FOR AI AGENTS

### The Big Picture Vision (READ ONLY - Don't Attempt)
This project is evolving toward an advanced AI-powered audio application with modern Android architecture:

**Core Product Vision:**
- 24/7 background audio recording with intelligent processing
- Real-time ML features: speech-to-text (Whisper), voice activity detection
- Advanced audio enhancement: RNNoise integration, FFmpeg processing  
- Smart segmentation and classification of audio content
- Clean, intuitive Android UI following expert design principles
- Production-ready testing for all features and migrations

**Technical Architecture Target** (see `documentation/echo-refactoring-plan.md`):
- Modern Clean Architecture with MVVM + Hilt DI + Coroutines
- Modular design: domain/data/presentation layers
- Kotlin-first with coroutines for all async operations
- Advanced audio pipeline with ML integration
- Expert Android UI/UX design with Material You principles
- Timeline: 8-week phased refactoring plan
- Current Phase: Phase 1 - Foundation & stabilization

### CRITICAL: Incremental Development Principles
1. **NEVER break existing functionality** - Always maintain current features
2. **ALWAYS fix errors first** - Build/test/integration failures take absolute priority
3. **ALWAYS add comprehensive tests** - Every migration/feature needs production-ready testing
4. **Make smallest possible changes** - Incremental is always better than big changes

### Decision Framework for Small Changes
When choosing between multiple small fixes, prefer changes that align with the vision:

1. **Fix errors FIRST** - Build, unit, integration, functional test failures
2. **Use Research Frameworks for Technical Decisions**:
   - **RESEARCH_FRAMEWORK.md** - Overall research-driven development methodology
   - **ML_STRATEGY_FRAMEWORK.md** - ML research and implementation strategy  
   - **PERFORMANCE_RESEARCH_FRAMEWORK.md** - Performance optimization research
   - **UI_UX_ENHANCEMENT_FRAMEWORK.md** - Professional UI development framework
   - **KOTLIN_MIGRATION_FRAMEWORK.md** - Java-to-Kotlin conversion methodology
3. **Prioritize foundation work** - Kotlin migration before UI enhancement
4. **Make incremental improvements** - Small, well-tested changes that compound
2. **Kotlin over Java** - Convert utilities when fixing them (but don't break existing)
3. **Coroutines over Threads** - Use suspend functions for async fixes  
4. **Result types over exceptions** - Wrap operations in Result<T>
5. **Comprehensive testing** - Add tests for any code you touch
6. **UI/UX improvements** - Modern Material You patterns for frontend changes
7. **Separation of concerns** - Keep UI, business logic, and data separate

### Change Quality Assessment
When documenting changes, note alignment and testing:
- ‚úÖ **FIXES-ERRORS**: Resolves build/test/integration failures
- ‚úÖ **WELL-TESTED**: Includes comprehensive tests for production readiness
- ‚úÖ **ARCHITECTURAL**: Moves toward Clean Architecture (incrementally)
- ‚úÖ **MODERN**: Uses modern Android patterns (coroutines, Material You, etc.)
- ‚úÖ **UI-EXPERT**: Follows expert Android design principles
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **LEGACY**: Fixes issue but maintains old patterns (acceptable if well-tested)

### Example: Priority-Ordered Fixes
```
PRIORITY 1 - ERROR FIXES (Always first):
‚úÖ "Fix failing RecordingViewModelTest with proper test setup"
‚úÖ "Resolve build compilation errors in audio module"
‚úÖ "Fix integration test timeouts with proper resource cleanup"

PRIORITY 2 - TESTED IMPROVEMENTS:  
‚úÖ "Convert AudioManager to Kotlin with comprehensive unit tests"
‚úÖ "Add Result<T> to file operations with integration tests"
‚úÖ "Improve UI button accessibility with UI tests"

PRIORITY 3 - ARCHITECTURAL (Only if no errors):
‚úÖ "Extract repository pattern with full test coverage" 
‚úÖ "Add Hilt DI to single module with integration tests"
```

### Frontend Innovation Guidelines
When touching UI code, follow expert Android design:
- **Material You** design system and dynamic theming
- **Accessibility first** - proper content descriptions, navigation
- **Intuitive navigation** - clear user flows and interaction patterns  
- **Performance** - smooth animations, responsive interactions
- **Clean visual hierarchy** - proper spacing, typography, colors
- **User testing** - UI tests for all interactive elements

## üî¨ RESEARCH & CI INTEGRATION TOOLS

### Available MCP Server Integration
When implementing features or optimizing performance, use available MCP servers for enhanced capabilities:

#### GitHub MCP Server (Already Available)
**Use for**: CI/CD workflow monitoring and artifact analysis
- Monitor GitHub Actions workflow runs and build status

**Confirmed Available Functions:**
```javascript
// Check workflow status and runs
list_workflow_runs({
  owner: "ElliotBadinger",
  repo: "echo",
  workflow_id: "android-ci.yml"
})

// Get specific workflow run details
get_workflow_run({
  owner: "ElliotBadinger", 
  repo: "echo",
  run_id: 12345
})

// Download test artifacts for analysis
download_workflow_run_artifact({
  owner: "ElliotBadinger",
  repo: "echo", 
  artifact_id: 67890
})

// Get job logs for debugging failures
get_job_logs({
  owner: "ElliotBadinger",
  repo: "echo",
  run_id: 12345,
  failed_only: true,  // Get logs for failed jobs only

## üìã SPECIFIC WORKFLOWS BY TASK TYPE

### For Build Failures:
1. Read the error message carefully
2. Identify the specific file and line causing issues
3. Check if it's a dependency, import, or syntax issue
4. Make the minimal fix needed
5. Test compilation before proceeding

### For Test Failures:
1. Run the specific failing test in isolation
2. Read the stack trace to understand the failure
3. Check if dependencies or mocking setup are correct
4. Fix one test at a time
5. Verify the fix with repeated test runs

### For New Feature Development:
1. **DON'T** - Focus on fixing existing issues first
2. If absolutely necessary, implement in smallest possible increments
3. Add tests for any new functionality
4. Update documentation

---

## üö´ CRITICAL DON'Ts - THINGS THAT ALWAYS FAIL

### Never Attempt These in One Session:
- ‚ùå "Refactor the architecture"
- ‚ùå "Migrate everything to Compose"
- ‚ùå "Fix all threading issues"
- ‚ùå "Implement dependency injection"
- ‚ùå "Rewrite the service layer"

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid:
- ‚ùå Making multiple unrelated changes at once
- ‚ùå Assuming context from previous conversations
- ‚ùå Starting work without reading current documentation
- ‚ùå Ignoring test failures to "move forward"
- ‚ùå Making changes without understanding their impact

### Signs You're Doing Too Much:
- You're modifying more than 3 files
- Your change affects multiple modules
- You're adding new architectural patterns
- The change takes more than 30 minutes to implement
- You can't easily explain exactly what you changed

---

## ‚úÖ BEST PRACTICES - THINGS THAT WORK

### Successful Change Patterns:
- ‚úÖ Add one missing dependency
- ‚úÖ Fix one import error
- ‚úÖ Resolve one specific compilation issue
- ‚úÖ Update one test to work correctly
- ‚úÖ Add one missing configuration property

### Effective Debugging Approach:
- Start with the error message
- Find the smallest reproduction case
- Fix the immediate cause, not the underlying architecture
- Test the fix thoroughly
- Document what you learned

### Good Progress Indicators:
- Build success rate improves
- Fewer compilation errors
- Tests that were failing now pass
- Clear path forward for next change

---

## üìù DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### ALWAYS Update These Files:

#### AGENT_DOCUMENTATION.md:
- Add entry to "Current Active Changes" section
- Update "Current Status" if project state changed
- Update "Current Session Workspace" section
- Move completed goals from priority list

#### Change Log Entry Template:
```markdown

## üîç TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### When Builds Fail:

1. **Read the error carefully** - Don't skim
2. **Identify the specific cause** - compilation vs runtime vs test
3. **Check recent changes** - what did you change that might cause this?
4. **Isolate the problem** - run smaller parts of the build
5. **Fix the immediate cause** - not the root architectural issue

### When Tests Fail:

1. **Run just the failing test** - `./gradlew :module:test --tests SpecificTestName`
2. **Check the full stack trace** - not just the summary
3. **Verify test dependencies** - are all required libraries present?
4. **Check mocking setup** - are mocks configured correctly?
5. **Test in isolation** - comment out other tests if needed

### When Git Push Fails:

```bash
# If push is rejected, first pull latest changes
git pull origin main

# If there are conflicts, resolve them manually
git status                 # See conflicted files
# Edit files to resolve conflicts
git add .
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
git push origin HEAD
```

## üîö FINAL REMINDERS

### Every Single Session:
1. **Read the documentation first** - No exceptions
2. **Make small changes** - Resist the urge to do more
3. **Test immediately** - After every change
4. **Document everything** - Your future self will thank you
5. **Use MCP server** - Don't use manual git commands
6. **Push changes** - Don't leave work uncommitted

### When in Doubt:
- Choose the smaller change
- Fix one specific error message
- Ask for clarification rather than guessing
- Focus on immediate problems, not architectural ones
- Follow the checklist in `AGENT_SESSION_CHECKLIST.md`

### Remember:
**The goal is not to solve everything in one session. The goal is to make consistent, verifiable progress that builds up over time.**

---

**üéØ Quick Start Summary:**
1. Read `AGENT_DOCUMENTATION.md` completely
2. Check current build status: `./gradlew clean && ./gradlew build`
3. Pick the smallest next goal from the priority list
4. Make one small change and test it immediately
5. Document the change and use MCP server to push
6. Update handoff instructions for next session

**Good luck and happy coding! üöÄ**
