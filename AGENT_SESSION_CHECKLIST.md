# Agent Session Checklist - Echo Project

## üöÄ START OF SESSION (Do this FIRST, always)

### 1. Orientation Phase (5-10 minutes)
- [ ] Read `AGENT_DOCUMENTATION.md` completely
- [ ] Check current project state: `./gradlew --version` and basic build status
- [ ] Review last 3 entries in the Change Log section
- [ ] Identify what the previous session was working on
- [ ] Check if there are any pending/broken changes that need fixing first

### 2. Current State Assessment (5 minutes)
- [ ] Run: `./gradlew clean` (note: may timeout, that's expected)
- [ ] Check if tests run: `./gradlew test` (also may fail, document what fails)
- [ ] Look for any obvious error messages or build failures
- [ ] Update "Current Status" section with any new findings

## üéØ PLANNING PHASE (Before making ANY changes)

### 3. Goal Selection (10 minutes)
- [ ] Review the "Current Priority Goals" list in documentation
- [ ] Select the SMALLEST possible goal that can be completed in this session
- [ ] Write down exactly what success looks like for this goal
- [ ] Plan how you will verify the change works
- [ ] Consider what could go wrong and how to rollback

### 4. Pre-Change Documentation
- [ ] **USE TIME MCP**: Call `get_current_time({timezone: "UTC"})` for accurate timestamps
- [ ] Create new Change Log entry with template using correct UTC time
- [ ] Document exactly what you plan to change
- [ ] List all files you expect to modify
- [ ] Note current state of those files

### 4.1 Error-First Decision Framework
Before making ANY changes, prioritize in this exact order:

#### Step 1: Check for Critical Issues (MUST FIX FIRST)
- [ ] **Build errors** - Any compilation failures
- [ ] **Test failures** - Unit, integration, or UI tests failing
- [ ] **Runtime crashes** - App crashes or ANRs
- [ ] **CI/CD failures** - GitHub Actions workflow failures

#### Step 2: Use Research Frameworks for Technical Decisions
For any significant technical work, consult the appropriate framework:
- [ ] **RESEARCH_FRAMEWORK.md** - Overall research-driven development methodology
- [ ] **ML_STRATEGY_FRAMEWORK.md** - ML research and implementation strategy  
- [ ] **PERFORMANCE_RESEARCH_FRAMEWORK.md** - Performance optimization research
- [ ] **UI_UX_ENHANCEMENT_FRAMEWORK.md** - Professional UI development framework
- [ ] **KOTLIN_MIGRATION_FRAMEWORK.md** - Java-to-Kotlin conversion methodology

#### Step 3: Apply Incremental Improvement Strategy
- [ ] **Build Errors**: Are there any compilation failures?
- [ ] **Test Failures**: Are any unit/integration tests failing?
- [ ] **Runtime Crashes**: Are there any exceptions or crashes?
- [ ] **Resource Issues**: File locks, memory leaks, resource cleanup problems?

**If ANY of these exist, fix them FIRST before any other work.**

#### Step 2: Plan Incremental Improvement (Only if no critical issues)
- [ ] **Maintains Functionality**: Will existing features continue working?
- [ ] **Comprehensive Testing**: Can I add complete tests for this change?
- [ ] **Incremental**: Is this the smallest possible improvement?
- [ ] **Architecture Alignment**: Does this move toward modern patterns?
- [ ] **UI Excellence**: If touching UI, does this follow expert design principles?

#### Step 3: Testing Requirements Check
Every change must include:
- [ ] **Unit Tests**: Test the component in isolation
- [ ] **Integration Tests**: Test how it works with other components  
- [ ] **Error Handling Tests**: Test failure scenarios
- [ ] **Regression Tests**: Verify existing functionality still works
- [ ] **UI Tests**: If changing UI, test user interactions
- [ ] **Performance Tests**: If affecting audio/ML, measure performance

### 4.2 Decision Examples

#### SCENARIO: Multiple issues exist
```markdown
Current Issues:
- RecorderService crashes on startup (CRITICAL)  
- UI button could be more Material You styled (ENHANCEMENT)
- AudioBuffer could use coroutines (ARCHITECTURAL)

CORRECT ORDER:
1. ‚úÖ Fix RecorderService crash + add crash prevention tests
2. ‚úÖ Convert AudioBuffer to coroutines + add concurrency tests  
3. ‚úÖ Style UI button with Material You + add interaction tests

WRONG ORDER:
‚ùå Start with UI styling while crashes exist
‚ùå Do architectural work before fixing stability
```

#### SCENARIO: Choosing between architectural approaches
```markdown
Problem: Audio threading issues

‚ùå LEGACY: "Add synchronized blocks to existing methods"
‚úÖ BETTER: "Convert to suspend functions with proper dispatchers + concurrency tests"

Problem: File operation errors  

‚ùå LEGACY: "Add try-catch blocks around operations"
‚úÖ BETTER: "Wrap in Result<T> with comprehensive error handling tests"

Problem: UI component needs improvement

‚ùå LEGACY: "Quick styling fix"
‚úÖ BETTER: "Redesign with Material You principles + accessibility tests"
```

#### SCENARIO: Testing requirements
```markdown
Change: Convert AudioManager to Kotlin

Required Tests:
‚úÖ Unit: Test AudioManager methods in isolation
‚úÖ Integration: Test AudioManager with RecordingService  
‚úÖ Error: Test AudioManager with invalid input/permissions
‚úÖ Performance: Measure audio processing latency
‚úÖ Regression: Verify existing recording functionality works

Missing Tests:
‚ùå Only unit tests - insufficient for production readiness
‚ùå No error handling tests - could cause crashes
‚ùå No performance validation - could affect real-time audio
```
### 4.3 Research-Enhanced Decision Making

#### Pre-Implementation Research Process:
**For any significant change (threading, performance, UI, ML), conduct research FIRST:**

**STEP 1 - Discovery (Brave Search MCP):**
- [ ] Search for SOTA techniques: `brave_web_search({query: "...", summary: true})`
- [ ] Find performance benchmarks: Include "benchmarks", "optimization", current year
- [ ] Locate implementation guides: Search official documentation sites
- [ ] Document source quality: Academic papers > official docs > blog posts

**STEP 2 - Deep Extraction (Playwright MCP):**
- [ ] Extract complete research papers: `browser_navigate()` ‚Üí `browser_pdf_save()`
- [ ] Get full documentation: `browser_snapshot()` for structured content
- [ ] Collect code examples: Extract implementation patterns
- [ ] Gather performance data: Benchmarks, optimization techniques, constraints

**STEP 3 - Research Validation:**
- [ ] Cross-reference multiple sources: Ensure consistency across findings
- [ ] Assess mobile applicability: Android constraints, device limitations
- [ ] Set quantified targets: Performance goals based on research
- [ ] Plan validation strategy: How to measure success with GitHub MCP

**STEP 4 - Implementation with CI Validation (GitHub MCP):**
- [ ] Apply research findings incrementally: Small, testable changes
- [ ] Monitor CI performance: `list_workflow_runs()` for benchmark tracking
- [ ] Compare to research predictions: Measured vs. expected improvements
- [ ] Document accuracy: How well research predicted actual results

#### Research Integration Examples:

**SCENARIO: Audio processing optimization**
```
‚úÖ Brave Search: "WebRTC audio processing mobile latency reduction 2024"
‚úÖ Playwright: Extract complete WebRTC documentation + research papers
‚úÖ Implementation: Apply buffer management techniques from research
‚úÖ GitHub MCP: Measure latency improvements through CI benchmarks
‚úÖ Validation: Compare measured latency against research predictions
```

**SCENARIO: UI performance improvement**
```
‚úÖ Brave Search: "jetpack compose performance optimization 2024 case studies"
‚úÖ Playwright: Extract complete Compose performance guides + benchmark data
‚úÖ Implementation: Apply research-backed optimization techniques
‚úÖ GitHub MCP: Monitor UI performance through automated testing
‚úÖ Validation: Measure frame rates against research-established targets
```

### 4.4 UI/UX Excellence Standards
When making frontend changes, ensure:
- [ ] **Material You Design**: Uses modern design tokens and theming
- [ ] **Accessibility**: Proper content descriptions, focus management
- [ ] **Expert Layout**: Clean visual hierarchy, proper spacing
- [ ] **Intuitive Navigation**: Clear user flow and interaction patterns
- [ ] **Performance**: Smooth animations, responsive touch feedback
- [ ] **UI Testing**: Comprehensive interaction and accessibility tests

### 4.4 Production Readiness Checklist
Before completing any change:
- [ ] **All tests pass**: Unit, integration, error, performance tests
- [ ] **No regressions**: Existing functionality verified working  
- [ ] **Error handling**: Comprehensive error scenarios covered
- [ ] **Documentation**: Change properly documented with examples
- [ ] **Performance**: No degradation in critical paths
- [ ] **Accessibility**: UI changes include accessibility testing

## üîß EXECUTION PHASE (Making changes)

### 5. Make Changes (Incremental approach)
- [ ] Make ONE small change at a time
- [ ] Test immediately after each change
- [ ] If something breaks, rollback immediately
- [ ] Document each successful incremental change
- [ ] Never make multiple unrelated changes at once

### 6. Verification Requirements
- [ ] Build succeeds (or fails in expected/better way)
- [ ] Tests pass (or fail in fewer/different ways)
- [ ] No new errors introduced
- [ ] Feature works as intended (if applicable)
- [ ] Performance hasn't degraded

### 6.1 Enhanced Testing & Research Integration

#### Testing Strategy Decision Matrix:
**Use Local Testing When:**
- [ ] Small, isolated changes (single function, simple bug fix)
- [ ] Changes don't affect audio/performance critical paths
- [ ] Quick iteration needed for development workflow
- [ ] Limited to single module/component

**Use GitHub Actions CI When:**
- [ ] Changes affect multiple modules or core architecture
- [ ] Audio processing or performance-critical modifications  
- [ ] Need matrix testing across Android API levels
- [ ] Complex integration testing required
- [ ] Local testing is slow (>5 minutes) or resource-intensive

#### GitHub Actions Integration Process:
```javascript
// 1. Push changes and trigger CI
push_files({
  owner: "ElliotBadinger",
  repo: "echo", 
  branch: "current-branch",
  message: "Agent: [specific change description]",
  files: [{path: "file.kt", content: "..."}]
})

// 2. Monitor workflow progress
list_workflow_runs({
  owner: "ElliotBadinger",
  repo: "echo",
  workflow_id: "android-ci.yml",
  per_page: 5
})

// 3. If failures occur, get detailed logs
get_job_logs({
  owner: "ElliotBadinger", 
  repo: "echo",
  run_id: 12345,
  failed_only: true,
  return_content: true
})

// 4. Download artifacts for analysis
download_workflow_run_artifact({
  owner: "ElliotBadinger",
  repo: "echo",
  artifact_id: 67890
})
```

#### Research Integration Guidelines:

**Research Tool Selection Decision Tree:**

**STEP 1 - Identify Research Need:**

## üìù END OF SESSION (Do this BEFORE ending)

### 7. Documentation Updates
- [ ] **USE TIME MCP**: Call `get_current_time({timezone: "UTC"})` for completion timestamp
- [ ] Complete the Change Log entry with results and accurate UTC time
- [ ] Update issue statuses if anything was resolved
- [ ] Update "Current Status" section if project state changed
- [ ] Move completed goals from priority list
- [ ] Add any newly discovered issues to the issue list

### 8. Handoff Preparation
- [ ] Fill in "Next Agent Should Focus On" section
- [ ] Highlight any partially completed work
- [ ] Note any new insights about persistent issues
- [ ] Update "Today's Focus" and "Changes Made This Session"

### 9. Git Operations (Use MCP Server!)
- [ ] Use `push_files()` MCP function to commit and push all changes
- [ ] Never use manual git commands when MCP server is available
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Always verify changes are successfully pushed to repository
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: If MCP push fails, use manual git commands: `git add .`, `git commit -m "message"`, `git push origin HEAD`
- [ ] **CRITICAL**: Resolve any merge conflicts with `git pull --rebase` before pushing
- [ ] Update README.md if any major functionality changed
- [ ] **VERIFY**: Check GitHub to confirm changes are visible

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL WARNINGS

### Things to NEVER do:
- ‚ùå Don't start making changes without reading documentation first
- ‚ùå Don't attempt large architectural changes in one session
- ‚ùå Don't assume context from previous conversations
- ‚ùå Don't make changes without testing them immediately
- ‚ùå Don't end session without documenting what you did
- ‚ùå Don't use manual git commands when MCP server is available

### Emergency Rollback Process:
If you break something badly:
1. **STOP** making changes immediately
2. Identify exactly what you changed
3. Revert changes one by one in reverse order
4. Test after each revert
5. **COMMIT AND PUSH** reverted state immediately
6. Document what went wrong and why
7. Update documentation with lessons learned

## üìä Session Success Indicators

### Minimum Success (any session should achieve at least one):
- [ ] Fixed one small build issue
- [ ] Resolved one test failure
- [ ] Made one incremental improvement to code
- [ ] Gained better understanding of one problem area
- [ ] Updated documentation with new insights

### Good Success:
- [ ] Completed one full priority goal
- [ ] Made measurable progress toward larger goal
- [ ] Improved build or test stability
- [ ] Added useful new documentation

### Excellent Success:
- [ ] Completed multiple small goals
- [ ] Resolved a persistent issue
- [ ] Made significant progress on high-priority item
- [ ] Left clear path forward for next session

## üéØ Quick Reference - Current Priorities

Based on documentation, current top priorities are:
1. **Build System:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED (100% success rate achieved)
2. **RecordingViewModelTest:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED (now passes successfully)
3. **Other Test Failures:** üü° NEEDS INVESTIGATION (focus here next)
4. **SaidItService Threading:** üî¥ ACTIVE ISSUE (threading violations)
5. **AudioMemory Thread Safety:** üü° POTENTIAL ISSUE (needs investigation)

## ü§ñ MCP Server Integration Reminders

### Always Use MCP Functions Instead of Manual Git:
- ‚úÖ `push_files()` - Push multiple files in one commit (PREFERRED)
- ‚úÖ `create_or_update_file()` - Create/update individual files
- ‚úÖ `get_file_contents()` - Read files from repository
- ‚ùå Don't use: `git add`, `git commit`, `git push` commands

### Example MCP Usage:
```javascript
// At end of session - push all changes at once
push_files({
  owner: "ElliotBadinger",
  repo: "echo",
  branch: "refactor/phase1-modularization-kts-hilt",
  message: "Agent Session [DATE]: Fixed [specific issue]",
  files: [
    {path: "build.gradle.kts", content: "..."},
    {path: "AGENT_DOCUMENTATION.md", content: "...updated docs..."}
  ]
})

// If MCP fails, use manual git:
git add .
git commit -m "Agent Session [DATE]: Fixed [specific issue]"
git pull --rebase origin branch-name  // Resolve conflicts if needed
git push origin HEAD
```

---

**Remember: Small incremental progress is better than grand failures. Use MCP server functions for all Git operations. Every change should be documented and tested immediately.**
