# Echo - Never Miss a Moment

Echo is a modern Android application that continuously records audio in the background, allowing you to go back in time and save moments that have already happened. Whether it's a brilliant idea, a funny quote, or an important note, Echo ensures you never miss it.

## üöÄ Quick Start for Users

### What Echo Does
- **Continuous Background Recording:** Records audio silently in the background with a rolling buffer
- **Time-Travel Audio:** Save clips from moments that already happened
- **Auto-Save:** Never lose important audio when memory buffer fills
- **Modern Interface:** Clean Material You design
- **Customizable:** Adjust audio quality and memory usage

### Installation & Usage
1. Install the app on your Android device (minimum API 30)
2. Grant audio recording permissions when prompted
3. The app starts recording automatically in the background
4. Use the interface to save clips from recent audio
5. Access saved recordings through the app's library

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- **Android Studio** (Latest stable version recommended)
- **JDK 17** (Required for this project)
- **Android SDK** with API level 30+
- **Git** for version control

### Building the Project
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/echo.git
cd echo

# Create local.properties file (replace with your SDK path)
echo "sdk.dir=/path/to/your/android/sdk" > local.properties

# Build the project
./gradlew clean build

# Install on connected device
./gradlew installDebug
```

### Project Status
- **Build Status:** üü¢ Fully working (100% success rate - full build completes successfully)
- **Architecture:** Currently undergoing refactoring from monolithic to modular design
- **Active Development:** Focus on improving test coverage and runtime stability
- **Recent Success:** RecordingViewModelTest fixed, compilation errors resolved

## ü§ñ AI Agent Development Workflow

**IMPORTANT:** This project uses AI agents for development assistance and has GitHub MCP server integration. If you're working with Claude or other AI assistants, follow this workflow for best results.

### üìã **FIRST TIME OR NEW CONVERSATION: Read This Guide**
üëâ **[Complete Agent Workflow Guide](AGENT_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md)** - Essential reading for AI-assisted development

### üéØ **Quick Reference for AI Agents**

#### Essential Files to Read First (In Order):
1. **`AGENT_DOCUMENTATION.md`** - Current project state, issues, and change tracking
2. **`AGENT_SESSION_CHECKLIST.md`** - Step-by-step session workflow
3. **`documentation/echo-critical-fixes.md`** - Critical build and infrastructure issues
4. **`documentation/echo-refactoring-plan.md`** - Long-term architectural roadmap

#### **COPY THIS PROMPT for New AI Sessions:**
```
I'm continuing work on the Echo Android project. Please:

1. Read the AGENT_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md file completely - this contains all essential instructions
2. Follow the AGENT_SESSION_CHECKLIST.md for proper workflow
3. Read AGENT_DOCUMENTATION.md to understand current project state
4. Check current build status with: cd echo && ./gradlew clean
5. Focus on the next small goal from the Current Priority Goals in documentation
6. Use GitHub MCP server functions (push_files, create_or_update_file) for all Git operations
7. Never attempt large architectural changes - focus on small, verifiable improvements

Current status: Build success rate is 100%, RecordingViewModelTest fixed. 
Focus on: improving other test failures, SaidItService threading issues, or runtime stability.
Follow the incremental change methodology documented in the guides.
```

#### **COPY THIS for Completed Feature/Fix Sessions:**
```
I just completed [describe what you implemented/fixed] on the Echo Android project. Please:

1. Read AGENT_DOCUMENTATION.md to understand current state and recent changes
2. Verify the completed work is properly documented in the change log
3. Check if there are any follow-up issues or improvements needed
4. Use GitHub MCP server to push any documentation updates or final fixes
5. Identify and start the next highest priority goal from the Current Priority Goals list
6. Update the "Next Agent Should Focus On" section with clear next steps

Current focus should be on: [check documentation for current priorities]
Always make small, incremental improvements rather than large architectural changes.
```

### üîÑ **Git Workflow for Changes**

#### **ü§ñ IMPORTANT FOR AI AGENTS: Use GitHub MCP Server Functions**

**‚úÖ PREFERRED METHOD - Use MCP Functions:**
```javascript
// Push multiple files at once (RECOMMENDED)
push_files({
  owner: "ElliotBadinger",
  repo: "echo",
  branch: "refactor/phase1-modularization-kts-hilt", // or current branch
  message: "Agent Session [DATE]: Fixed [specific issue] - description",
  files: [
    {path: "file1.kt", content: "..."},
    {path: "AGENT_DOCUMENTATION.md", content: "...updated docs..."}
  ]
})

// Or for single files
create_or_update_file({
  owner: "ElliotBadinger", 
  repo: "echo",
  path: "path/to/file.kt",
  content: "file content",
  message: "Agent: Fixed specific issue",
  branch: "refactor/phase1-modularization-kts-hilt"
})
```

#### **üîß FALLBACK: Manual Git (only if MCP unavailable):**
```bash
# Add all changes
git add .
# Commit with descriptive message
git commit -m "Agent Session [DATE]: Fixed [specific issue] - improved [metric]"
# Push to current branch  
git push origin HEAD
```

## üéØ Development Principles

### For Human Developers:
- Follow Android development best practices
- Use MVVM architecture pattern
- Implement proper testing at all levels
- Follow Material Design guidelines

### For AI Agents:
- **Use GitHub MCP server functions** for all Git operations (push_files, create_or_update_file, etc.)
- **Small incremental changes only** - never attempt large architectural changes  
- **Document every change** in AGENT_DOCUMENTATION.md with proper change log entries
- **Test immediately** after each change using ./gradlew commands
- **Never assume context** from previous conversations - always read current documentation
- **Follow the complete workflow** in AGENT_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md and AGENT_SESSION_CHECKLIST.md
