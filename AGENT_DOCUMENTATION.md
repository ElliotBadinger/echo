## 2. ARCHITECTURAL PLANNING FRAMEWORK

### Planning Principles
1. **Small Incremental Changes:** Every change must be the smallest possible unit that provides measurable progress
2. **Fail Fast, Document Everything:** Record all attempts, successful or not
3. **Verify Before Proceeding:** Each change must be verified to work before moving to next
4. **Rollback Strategy:** Every change must be easily reversible
5. **Use GitHub MCP Server:** Always use MCP functions (push_files, create_or_update_file) instead of manual git commands

### Current Architecture Issues (Priority Order)
1. **P0 - Build System Instability** ‚úÖ RESOLVED
   - ~~Gradle timeouts~~
   - ~~Dependency version conflicts~~ 
   - ~~Memory allocation issues~~
2. **P0 - Threading Problems**
   - SaidItService threading violations
   - AudioMemory thread safety
   - File lock contention
3. **P1 - Tight Coupling**
   - Service does everything
   - No proper separation of concerns
   - Hard to test individual components

## 5. SESSION HANDOFF GUIDELINES

### For New Claude Sessions
When starting a new session, the new agent should:

1. **Read this entire document first**
2. **Check the current project state** by running basic build/test commands
3. **Review recent changes** in the change log section
4. **Identify the next small goal** from the priority list
5. **Never assume previous session context** - verify current state
6. **Use GitHub MCP server functions** for all Git operations instead of manual commands

### Information to Update
Every agent session should update:
- **Current Status** section with latest state
- **Change Log** with any changes made
- **Issue Status** updates for anything resolved or discovered
- **Next Priority Goals** based on current progress

### Critical Don'ts for New Sessions
- ‚ùå Don't start with large architectural changes
- ‚ùå Don't assume any previous context about conversations
- ‚ùå Don't make changes without understanding current state
- ‚ùå Don't skip documentation of changes made
- ‚ùå Don't use manual git commands when GitHub MCP server is available
