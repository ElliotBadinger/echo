## 2. TIER 1 CRITICAL ERROR - ANDROID SDK MISSING ✅ RESOLVED

### Critical Issue Found and Fixed
**ANDROID SDK MISSING ERROR**: Build failing with SDK location not found:
```
Could not determine the dependencies of task ':audio:extractDebugAnnotations'.
SDK location not found. Define a valid SDK location with an ANDROID_HOME environment variable
```

### Root Cause Analysis
The development environment was missing Android SDK setup:
- ❌ Android SDK not installed
- ❌ ANDROID_HOME environment variable not set
- ❌ Platform tools and build tools not available
- ❌ Android API 34 platform not installed

### Resolution Completed
- ✅ Installed Android SDK command line tools
- ✅ Set ANDROID_HOME=/opt/android-sdk
- ✅ Installed platform-tools, android-34 platform, build-tools 34.0.0
- ✅ Accepted all required SDK licenses
- ✅ Verified build works: 3m 7s compilation, 2s test execution
