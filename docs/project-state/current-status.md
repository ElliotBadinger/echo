# Current Project Status

**Version:** 2.0 - Unified Documentation System
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-06 10:30 UTC
**Status:** Active Development - TIER 2 Views.java Conversion Complete, Ready for Next TIER 2 Target (UserInfo.java)

## 🎯 Project Overview

Echo is a modern Android audio recording application featuring:
- 24/7 background audio recording with intelligent processing
- Real-time ML features (Whisper, VAD integration planned)
- Material You UI design with accessibility focus
- Clean Architecture with MVVM pattern and dependency injection
- Comprehensive testing with 93% pass rate

## 📊 Current Critical Status

### Build System Health
- **Build Status:** ✅ FULLY OPERATIONAL
- **Android SDK:** ✅ Configured and functional
- **CI Pipeline:** ✅ GitHub Actions working correctly
- **Clean Build Time:** ~20-30 seconds
- **Test Execution:** ~5 seconds

### Architecture Modernization
- **Audio Pipeline:** ✅ MODERNIZED - Threading converted to Kotlin coroutines
- **UI Layer:** ✅ STABLE - Java-based UI functional
- **Testing:** ✅ EXCELLENT - 93% test pass rate (14/15 tests pass)
- **Architecture:** ✅ IMPROVED - SaidItService modernized, Clock interface modernized

### Key Metrics
- **Build Success Rate:** 100% (compiles successfully, all functionality works)
- **Test Pass Rate:** 93% (14/15 tests pass; AudioMemoryTest local environment issue documented)
- **Code Coverage:** Good (can now measure with successful compilation)
- **Technical Debt:** SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED (duplicate class cleanup + Clock modernization completed)

## 🚨 Critical Agent Workflow Rules

### GitHub MCP vs Local Git Synchronization
**⚠️ CRITICAL ISSUE:** GitHub MCP tools create commits directly on GitHub, bypassing local git.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW:**
1. **NEVER use GitHub MCP push_files() without explicit user permission**
2. **ALWAYS check if user has local uncommitted changes first**
3. **If user has local changes:**
   - Ask user to commit/stash changes first
   - OR create files locally and let user handle git operations
4. **GitHub MCP should only be used for:**
   - Emergency fixes when user explicitly requests it
   - When user confirms their local repo is clean
   - When user explicitly asks agent to push to GitHub

**SAFE GitHub MCP Functions (Read-Only Only):**
- `list_workflow_runs()` - Monitor CI status
- `get_job_logs()` - Debug CI failures
- `download_workflow_run_artifact()` - Analyze test results
- `get_file_contents()` - Read repository files

**REQUIRED: Use Manual Git Commands for ALL Commits:**
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Agent Session [DATE]: Description"
git push origin HEAD
```

## 🔧 Current Development Phase

### TIER 1 - Critical Errors ✅ COMPLETED
1. **Android SDK Missing** - ✅ RESOLVED
2. **AudioMemoryTest ClassNotFoundException** - ✅ DEFINITIVELY RESOLVED
   - **Root Cause**: KaptBaseError during annotation processing in CI environment
   - **Solution**: Comprehensive Kapt configuration (correctErrorTypes=true, useBuildCache=false, Hilt args)
   - **Validation**: CI run #66 - ALL tests pass, including AudioMemoryTest.kt
   - **Status**: 100% resolved, no local environment issues
3. **Build Compilation** - ✅ VERIFIED (100% success rate maintained)
4. **Test Execution** - ✅ VERIFIED (100% pass rate achieved)

### TIER 2 - Incremental Improvements (Current Focus)
**Strategic Decision: Complete Kotlin migration first, then UI enhancement**

#### Kotlin Migration Progress
- ✅ **StringFormat.java → StringFormat.kt** - COMPLETED with comprehensive tests
- ✅ **Clock.java → Clock.kt** - 100% COMPLETE (interface modernized, integration verified)
- ✅ **TimeFormat.java → TimeFormat.kt** - COMPLETED with comprehensive tests
- ✅ **Views.java → Views.kt** - COMPLETED with modern extension functions and comprehensive tests
- ✅ **UserInfo.java → UserInfo.kt** - 100% COMPLETE (user data utility modernized with security enhancements)
- 🎯 **NEXT TARGET:** `IntentResult.java → IntentResult.kt` (Phase 2: Core Components) - HIGH PRIORITY

#### Migration Methodology
- Each conversion includes unit tests, integration tests, and regression testing
- CI validation for clean environment testing
- Maintains 100% build success and test pass rates
- Research-driven approach using MCP tools
