# Current Project Priorities

**Version:** 2.2 - MockK Compilation Issues Resolved
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-09 12:35 UTC
**Strategy:** Error-First (Satisfied), Incremental, Well-Tested Development

---

## 🎯 Priority Framework

### TIER 1 - Critical Errors
**Status:** ✅ RESOLVED - No active blocking issues

- ✅ **Kotlin Compilation Errors** - Fixed (MockK → Mockito conversion)
- ✅ **Gradle Build Hanging** - Resolved (root cause fixed)
- ✅ **CI Pipeline** - Operational (all modules included)

### TIER 2 - Incremental Improvements (ACTIVE)
**Status:** 🟢 ACTIVE - Ready for development
**Strategic Decision:** Complete Kotlin migration first, then UI enhancement

### TIER 3 - Architecture & Advanced Features (Planned)
**Status:** ⏳ After TIER 2 progress

---

## 🚀 TIER 2: Kotlin Migration (High Priority)

### Current Progress
- ✅ Multiple conversions complete with tests (StringFormat, Clock, TimeFormat, Views, UserInfo, IntentResult, BroadcastReceiver, AacMp4Writer, SaidItFragment)
- ✅ CI validation working for all modules
- ✅ Comprehensive tests added
- 🎯 **Next**: Continue Kotlin migration per migration plan

### Migration Methodology
1. Convert one file at a time (small, testable changes)
2. Add comprehensive unit tests
3. Validate locally and via CI
4. Document changes in change log (simple template)

### Success Criteria per Conversion
- ✅ Kotlin code compiles successfully
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ Comprehensive unit tests added
- ✅ CI validation passes
- ✅ No regression in test pass rate

### Suggested Next Targets
1. Remaining Java utilities and core components
2. Repository pattern extraction in data layer
3. ViewModel and DI improvements (Hilt)

---

## 🎨 TIER 3: Professional UI/UX Enhancement (Soon)

- Material You theming
- Accessibility improvements
- UI test automation
- Visual regression testing

---

## 🔧 Additional Improvements

### Testing Infrastructure
- Improve Robolectric config for SaidIt to reduce Android framework failures (18 tests)
- Add integration tests across modules

### Architecture Improvements
- Hilt DI setup
- Repository pattern
- Clean Architecture layering

---

## 📈 Priority Decision Framework

- Pick smallest, high-impact TIER 2 task
- Add tests with every change
- Validate locally and on CI
- Document using simple template

---

## ✅ Next Agent Actions (Immediate)

1. Continue Kotlin migration on next Java file
2. If working on Android framework tests, refine Robolectric config for SaidIt (fix 18 failing tests)
3. Keep CI green and tests passing after each change
4. Document each change in `docs/project-state/change-log.md`
