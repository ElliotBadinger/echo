# Current Project Priorities

**Version:** 2.2 - MockK Compilation Issues Resolved
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-09 12:35 UTC
**Strategy:** Error-First (Satisfied), Incremental, Well-Tested Development

---

## 🎯 Priority Framework

### TIER 1 - Critical Errors
**Status:** 🚨 **ACTIVE** - Migration Quality Audit Required

- ✅ **Kotlin Compilation Errors** - Fixed (MockK → Mockito conversion)
- ✅ **Gradle Build Hanging** - Resolved (root cause fixed)
- ✅ **CI Pipeline** - Operational (all modules included)
- 🚨 **NEW**: **Migration Quality Audit** - HIGHEST PRIORITY
  - EchoApp.kt tests are superficial (annotation-only)
  - AppModule.kt tests don't verify integration
  - AudioConfig architectural disconnect needs investigation
  - All previous migrations need comprehensive test validation

### TIER 2 - Incremental Improvements 
**Status:** ❌ **BLOCKED** - Awaiting migration quality audit completion
**Strategic Decision:** Complete quality audit first, then continue Kotlin migration

### TIER 3 - Architecture & Advanced Features (Planned)
**Status:** ⏳ After TIER 2 progress

---

## 🚀 TIER 2: Kotlin Migration (High Priority)

### Current Progress
- ✅ Multiple conversions complete with tests (StringFormat, Clock, TimeFormat, Views, UserInfo, IntentResult, BroadcastReceiver, AacMp4Writer, SaidItFragment)
- ✅ CI validation working for all modules
- ✅ Comprehensive tests added
- 🎯 **Next**: Continue Kotlin migration per migration plan

### Migration Methodology
1. Convert one file at a time (small, testable changes)
2. Add comprehensive unit tests
3. Validate locally and via CI
4. Document changes in change log (simple template)

### Success Criteria per Conversion
- ✅ Kotlin code compiles successfully
- ✅ All existing functionality preserved
- ✅ Comprehensive unit tests added
- ✅ CI validation passes
- ✅ No regression in test pass rate

### Suggested Next Targets
1. Remaining Java utilities and core components
2. Repository pattern extraction in data layer
3. ViewModel and DI improvements (Hilt)

---

## 🎨 TIER 3: Professional UI/UX Enhancement (Soon)

- Material You theming
- Accessibility improvements
- UI test automation
- Visual regression testing

---

## 🔧 Additional Improvements

### Testing Infrastructure
- Improve Robolectric config for SaidIt to reduce Android framework failures (18 tests)
- Add integration tests across modules

### Architecture Improvements
- Hilt DI setup
- Repository pattern
- Clean Architecture layering

---

## 📈 Priority Decision Framework

- Pick smallest, high-impact TIER 2 task
- Add tests with every change
- Validate locally and on CI
- Document using simple template

---

## 🚨 Next Agent Actions (MANDATORY - TIER 1)

**BEFORE ANY NEW MIGRATION WORK:**
1. **READ**: `docs/templates/migration-quality-audit.md` - Complete mandatory audit
2. **FIX**: EchoApp.kt tests - Add Application lifecycle and Hilt integration testing
3. **INVESTIGATE**: AppModule AudioConfig architectural issue - Is it used by SaidItService?
4. **UPGRADE**: All migration tests from annotation-checking to behavioral verification
5. **DOCUMENT**: Architectural decisions and any discovered issues

**ONLY AFTER AUDIT COMPLETE:**
6. Continue Kotlin migration with proper comprehensive testing
7. Focus on meaningful files (50+ lines, real business logic)
8. Document each change with architectural investigation results
