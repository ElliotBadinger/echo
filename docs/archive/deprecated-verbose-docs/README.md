# Deprecated Verbose Documentation

**Date Archived:** 2025-01-27
**Reason:** Documentation system refactoring - replaced with streamlined versions

## Files Archived

### Agent Workflow (Replaced)
- `detailed-guide.md` → Replaced by `core-principles.md` (400+ lines → 80 lines)
- `quick-start.md` → Redundant with simplified system
- `critical-principles.md` → Content merged into `core-principles.md`

### Templates (Replaced)
- `change-log-template.md` → Replaced by `simple-change-log.md`
- `session-report-template.md` → Replaced by simplified workflow
- `testing-template.md` → Replaced by inline guidance

## Refactoring Philosophy

These files were archived as part of a "Clarity Over Complexity" refactoring:
- **Problem:** 400+ line documents that were often ignored due to complexity
- **Solution:** 50-100 line documents that focus on essential information
- **Result:** Higher adoption rate and better compliance with quality standards

## Accessing Archived Content

If you need information from these archived files:
1. Check if the information exists in the new streamlined versions first
2. These archived files remain available for reference
3. Consider whether the information is truly essential before re-adding complexity

*The new system prioritizes actionable guidance over comprehensive documentation.*
