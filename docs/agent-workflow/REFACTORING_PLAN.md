# Agent Workflow Documentation Refactoring Plan

## Analysis Summary

After reviewing all workflow documents, here's what actually works for agents vs. what's bureaucratic overhead:

## What Actually Works (Keep/Improve)

### 1. Error-First Prioritization ✅
- TIER system (critical → warnings → improvements)
- Build errors before features
- **This is genuinely valuable and should be preserved**

### 2. MCP Integration Tracking ✅
- Research documentation with sources
- Tool effectiveness measurement
- Usage optimization guidelines
- **This is unique value-add that helps agents improve**

### 3. Project State Tracking ✅
- Current status with metrics
- Build health indicators
- Next session handoff
- **Essential for agent continuity**

### 4. Audit Process ✅
- Verify previous session claims
- Test coverage validation
- **Prevents building on faulty foundations**

## What's Over-Engineered (Reduce/Remove)

### 1. Excessive Process Documentation ❌
- 400+ line detailed guide
- Micro-management checklists
- Repetitive "what not to do" sections
- **Reduces to core principles only**

### 2. Bureaucratic Overhead ❌
- Step-by-step micro-tasks
- Excessive documentation requirements
- Rigid workflow enforcement
- **Streamline to essential checkpoints**

## Refactoring Actions

### Phase 1: Core Workflow (Keep Essential)
```
docs/agent-workflow/
├── core-principles.md      (50 lines - error-first, research-driven, incremental)
├── mcp-integration.md      (100 lines - research patterns, tool usage, tracking)
└── session-audit.md       (30 lines - verify previous work, test validation)
```

### Phase 2: Project State (Minimal Changes)
```
docs/project-state/
├── current-status.md       (keep as-is, works well)
├── change-log.md          (keep MCP tracking, reduce verbosity)
└── priorities.md          (streamline format)
```

### Phase 3: Remove Bureaucracy
- Delete redundant sections in detailed-guide.md
- Condense session-checklist.md to essential checkpoints
- Remove micro-management processes
- Keep only actionable guidance

## Success Metrics for Refactored System

### Agent Adoption Rate
- **Current**: Agents likely skip most documentation due to length
- **Target**: Agents actually read and follow core principles

### Time to Value
- **Current**: 15-20 minutes to read all documentation
- **Target**: 5 minutes to understand essentials

### Effectiveness Retention
- **Keep**: Error-first prioritization, MCP research patterns, audit process
- **Remove**: Process overhead, redundant warnings, micro-management

## Implementation Priority

1. **HIGH**: Create core-principles.md (distill essential patterns)
2. **HIGH**: Preserve MCP integration guidance (it's working)
3. **MEDIUM**: Streamline session workflow to checkpoints only
4. **LOW**: Clean up change-log verbosity (but keep MCP tracking)

## Bottom Line

The system has good bones (error-first, research-driven, MCP integration) but suffers from documentation bloat. Refactor to preserve the valuable patterns while removing bureaucratic overhead.

**Core Value**: Error-first + Research-driven + MCP tracking + Audit process
**Remove**: Process overhead + Micro-management + Redundant warnings
