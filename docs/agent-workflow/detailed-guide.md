# Complete AI Agent Workflow Guide for Echo Android Project

**Version:** 2.0 - Unified Documentation System  
**Target Audience:** Claude, ChatGPT, and other AI development assistants  
**Project:** Echo Android Application  
**Last Updated:** 2025-09-06 18:40 UTC

**IMPORTANT NOTE ON RESEARCHING FIXES:** When encountering errors or issues (especially TIER 1 build/test failures), **always research fixes using available MCP tools and frameworks before attempting changes**. This is a core principle you must know and apply rigorously: Use Brave Search MCP for state-of-the-art (SOTA) solutions and scientific papers, Context7 MCP for Android API documentation, and integrate findings from docs/frameworks/research-framework.md or specific frameworks like docs/frameworks/kotlin-migration.md. Document all research in change logs using the MCP usage template, including sources and how they apply to the fix.

---

## üöÄ NEW SESSION STARTUP PROCESS

### Phase 1: Orientation (10 minutes)

#### Step 1: Read Critical Documentation
```bash
# In this exact order:
1. Read docs/project-state/current-status.md (focus on "Current Status" and "Change Log")
2. Read docs/agent-workflow/session-checklist.md (your workflow template)
3. Check docs/project-state/priorities.md for current focus areas
4. Review docs/project-state/research-findings.md for latest research
```

#### Step 2: Assess Current Project State
```bash
# Run these commands to understand current state:
cd echo
./gradlew --version                    # Confirm environment
./gradlew clean                        # Should complete in ~20-30s
timeout 120s ./gradlew build          # May fail, document how/where
```

#### Step 3: Update Documentation
- Open `docs/project-state/current-status.md`
- Update "Current Session Workspace" section:
  - Fill in "Today's Focus"
  - Note any changes in build behavior
  - Record your session start time

### Phase 2: Goal Selection (5 minutes)

#### Choose the SMALLEST Possible Goal
- Look at "Current Priority Goals" in `docs/project-state/priorities.md`
- Select the topmost goal that seems achievable in 1-2 hours
- Break it down further if it seems too large
- Write down EXACTLY what success looks like

#### Success Criteria Template:
```
Goal: [Specific thing to fix/improve]
Success Metric: [How you'll know it worked]
Test Plan: [How you'll verify it works]
Rollback Plan: [How to undo if it breaks things]
```

---

## üîß MAKING CHANGES WORKFLOW

### The Golden Rules:

1.  **VERIFY PREVIOUS WORK FIRST** - Always audit the last session's changes before starting new work.
2.  **ONE CHANGE AT A TIME** - Never modify multiple unrelated things.
3.  **TEST IMMEDIATELY** - After each change, verify it works.
4.  **ROLLBACK ON FAILURE** - If something breaks, undo immediately.
5.  **DOCUMENT EVERYTHING** - Use the MCP usage template from docs/templates/mcp-usage-template.md.
6.  **USE MCP SERVERS** - Always use MCP tools for research and GitHub functions for repository operations.

### Change Process:

#### Step 1: Pre-Change Documentation
```markdown
## Change [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] - [CHANGE_ID]

### Goal
- What specific problem this addresses
- Expected outcome

### Research Conducted (if applicable)
- MCP Tool Used: [e.g., Brave Search MCP, Context7 MCP]
- Query: [e.g., "Android Kotlin Kapt stub conflicts fixes 2025"]
- Key Findings: [Summarize relevant solutions and sources]
- Application to Fix: [How research informs the planned change]

### Files Modified
- [List files you plan to change]

### Testing Plan
- How you'll verify this works
```

#### Step 2: Research Fixes (Mandatory for Errors/Fixes)
- **When Applicable**: Always for TIER 1 issues (e.g., build errors, test failures like ClassNotFoundException) or any non-trivial fix.
- **Process**:
  - Use **[Brave Search MCP](../mcp-integration/brave-search-guide.md)**: `brave_web_search({query: "specific error + Android Kotlin 2025", summary: true})` for SOTA fixes.
  - Use **[Context7 MCP](../mcp-integration/context7-guide.md)**: For Android-specific guidance, e.g., "Kapt configuration for Kotlin test classpath".
  - Cross-reference with frameworks: e.g., **[Kotlin Migration Framework](../frameworks/kotlin-migration.md)** for migration-related issues.
  - Consult **[Research Framework](../frameworks/research-framework.md)** for overall research methodology.
  - Document: Summarize findings, sources, and rationale in the pre-change log using **[MCP Usage Template](../templates/mcp-usage-template.md)**.
- **Know This Well**: Research is not optional‚Äîit's the foundation for informed, error-free changes. Avoid guessing; base fixes on documented best practices from **[Critical Principles](critical-principles.md)**.

#### Step 3: Make ONE Small Change
- Edit one file or fix one specific issue
- Keep the change as minimal as possible
- Do NOT make multiple changes at once

#### Step 4: Test Immediately
```bash
# For build changes:
./gradlew clean build

# For specific module changes:
./gradlew :module-name:compileDebugUnitTestKotlin

# For test fixes:
./gradlew :module-name:test
```

#### Step 5: Document MCP Usage
Use the **[MCP Usage Template](../templates/mcp-usage-template.md)** to track:
- Which MCP servers were used (see **[MCP Optimization Guide](../mcp-integration/mcp-optimization.md)**)
- Effectiveness of each tool
- Time saved through research
- Implementation success rate
- Cross-reference with specific MCP guides:
  - **[Context7 Guide](../mcp-integration/context7-guide.md)** for Android documentation
  - **[Brave Search Guide](../mcp-integration/brave-search-guide.md)** for research
  - **[GitHub MCP Guide](../mcp-integration/github-mcp-guide.md)** for CI/CD monitoring

#### Step 6: Commit and Push Changes
- **Preferred Method**: Use manual git commands for commits (see GitHub MCP synchronization warning below)
- **Verify Push Success**: Check that changes are visible on GitHub
- **Handle Merge Conflicts**: Resolve any conflicts before pushing

```bash
# The ONLY safe way to commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "Agent Session [DATE]: Description"
git push origin HEAD
```

#### Step 7: Verify GitHub Actions Workflow
- **Check Existing Workflow**: Read `.github/workflows/android-test.yml` to ensure it runs `./gradlew test` on push/pull_request
- **Monitor Workflow**: After pushing, use GitHub MCP functions to check run status
- **Document CI Results**: Update your change log with CI validation results

#### Step 8: Document Results
Complete the change log entry:
```markdown
### Result
- ‚úÖ SUCCESS: What worked and why
- ‚ùå FAILED: What didn't work and why
- üü° PARTIAL: What partially worked
- üîç MCP Insights: Learnings about MCP tool effectiveness

### Next Steps
- What should be done next
- MCP optimization opportunities identified

### Rollback Info
- How to revert if needed
```

## üö´ CRITICAL DON'Ts - THINGS THAT ALWAYS FAIL

### Never Attempt These in One Session:
- ‚ùå "Refactor the architecture"
- ‚ùå "Migrate everything to Compose"
- ‚ùå "Fix all threading issues"
- ‚ùå "Implement dependency injection"
- ‚ùå "Rewrite the service layer"

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid:
- ‚ùå Making multiple unrelated changes at once
- ‚ùå Assuming context from previous conversations
- ‚ùå Starting work without reading current documentation
- ‚ùå Ignoring test failures to "move forward"
- ‚ùå Making changes without understanding their impact

---

## ‚úÖ BEST PRACTICES - THINGS THAT WORK

### Successful Change Patterns:
- ‚úÖ Add one missing dependency
- ‚úÖ Fix one import error
- ‚úÖ Resolve one specific compilation issue
- ‚úÖ Update one test to work correctly
- ‚úÖ Add one missing configuration property

### Effective Debugging Approach:
- Start with the error message
- Find the smallest reproduction case
- Fix the immediate cause, not the underlying architecture
- Test the fix thoroughly
- Document what you learned

---

## üìù DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

### ALWAYS Update These Files:

#### Change Log Entry:
Use the **[Change Log Template](../templates/change-log-template.md)** which includes:
- MCP server usage tracking (see **[MCP Usage Template](../templates/mcp-usage-template.md)**)
- Research findings documentation (see **[Research Template](../templates/research-template.md)**)
- Implementation success metrics
- Time savings analysis

#### Project State Documentation:
- Update **[Current Status](../project-state/current-status.md)** with current build status

2. Update "Next Agent Should Focus On" section in **[Current Priorities](../project-state/priorities.md)** with:
   - Specific next task
   - Files that need attention
   - Expected challenges
   - Success criteria
3. Ensure compliance with **[Critical Principles](critical-principles.md)**
4. Update **[Current Status](../project-state/current-status.md)** if project state changed

#### Clean Up:
1. Ensure all changes are committed and pushed
2. Verify no uncommitted changes remain (`git status`)
3. Test that your changes don't break basic functionality

---

## üîç TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE

### When Builds Fail:
1. Read the error message carefully - Don't skim
2. Identify the specific cause - compilation vs runtime vs test
3. Check recent changes - what did you change that might cause this?
4. Isolate the problem - run smaller parts of the build
5. Fix the immediate cause - not the root architectural issue

### When Tests Fail:
1. Run just the failing test - `./gradlew :module:test --tests SpecificTestName`
2. Check the full stack trace - not just the summary
3. Verify test dependencies - are all required libraries present?
4. Check mocking setup - are mocks configured correctly?
5. Test in isolation - comment out other tests if needed
