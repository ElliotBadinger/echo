## 🛠️ Playwright Usage Patterns

### Initialization Checklist (Required)
- Run install once per environment boot (ensures browser availability)
- Validate configuration (credentials/paths if needed) before first navigation

### Robust Extraction Flow (Recommended)
1) Install (once): Ensure the browser is installed/bootstrapped
2) Navigate: Go to target URL
3) Wait: Wait for known on-page text (e.g., a heading string) to appear
4) Evaluate or Extract:
   - Prefer evaluating after the wait, targeting specific selectors or headings
   - If `evaluate` returns nothing, fall back to extracting page text content (not raw HTML) using the extraction step

### Fallback Strategy
- If DOM evaluation yields empty content, run a text-extract to capture the rendered page’s main content (headings + body) rather than HTML nodes.

### Do Not Mix Engines in One Flow
- Treat Playwright and Puppeteer as independent engines. Do not assume shared state.

### Documentation Extraction Workflow

#### Step 1: Navigate to Target Content
```javascript
// Navigate to documentation page
browser_navigate({
  url: "https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/media/mediarecorder"
})
```

#### Step 2: Extract Complete Content
```javascript
// Extract comprehensive documentation
browser_extract({
  instruction: "Extract the complete MediaRecorder API documentation including all methods, parameters, examples, and best practices"
})
```

#### Step 3: Save for Offline Analysis
```javascript
// Save extracted content for analysis
browser_snapshot({
  name: "android_mediarecorder_docs"
})
```

### Research Paper Extraction

#### Academic Content Extraction
```javascript
// Navigate to research paper
browser_navigate({
  url: "https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.12345"
})

// Extract complete paper content
browser_extract({
  instruction: "Extract the complete research paper including abstract, methodology, results, and conclusions"
})

// Save PDF for detailed analysis
browser_pdf_save({
  name: "audio_processing_research_paper"
})
```

### Multi-Source Research

#### Comprehensive Research Gathering
```javascript
// Research complex topics from multiple sources
const researchSources = [
  "https://developer.android.com/topic/architecture",
  "https://medium.com/androiddevelopers/modern-android-development",
  "https://proandroiddev.com/android-architecture-patterns"
];

for (const url of researchSources) {
  await browser_navigate({ url });
  const content = await browser_extract({
    instruction: "Extract key architecture patterns, benefits, and implementation considerations"
  });
  await browser_snapshot({ name: `architecture_research_${url.split('/').pop()}` });
}
```

  },
  {
    url: "https://proandroiddev.com/tag/audio",
    type: "community implementation",
    priority: "medium"
  }
];
```

#### Step 3: Comprehensive Extraction
```javascript
// Extract from each source

  });
  
  await browser_snapshot({
    name: `${researchRequirements.topic}_${source.type}_${Date.now()}`
  });
}
```

#### Step 4: Content Synthesis
```javascript
// Synthesize findings across sources
const synthesis = {
  official_patterns: extractOfficialPatterns(content),
  research_findings: extractResearchFindings(content),
  implementation_examples: extractCodeExamples(content),
  best_practices: extractBestPractices(content)
};

// Generate research summary
generateResearchSummary(synthesis);
```

### Framework-Specific Research

## 🚀 Advanced Playwright Techniques

### Multi-Page Research Strategies

#### Comprehensive Documentation Collection
```javascript
// Research complex topics across multiple pages
const comprehensiveResearch = async (topic) => {
  // Find related pages
  const searchResults = await browser_navigate({
    url: `https://developer.android.com/search?q=${encodeURIComponent(topic)}`
  });
  
  const relatedPages = await browser_extract({
    instruction: "Extract links to all relevant documentation pages for this topic"
  });
  
  // Extract from each related page
  const allContent = [];
  for (const page of relatedPages.slice(0, 5)) {  // Limit to top 5
    await browser_navigate({ url: page.url });
    const content = await browser_extract({
      instruction: `Extract comprehensive information about ${topic} from this page`
    });
    allContent.push(content);
  }
  
  // Synthesize comprehensive research
  return synthesizeResearch(allContent);
};
```

#### Research Paper Analysis
```javascript
// Extract and analyze research papers
const analyzeResearchPaper = async (paperUrl) => {
  await browser_navigate({ url: paperUrl });
  
  // Extract paper structure
  const paperStructure = await browser_extract({
    instruction: "Extract the paper's title, authors, abstract, methodology, results, and conclusions"
  });
  
  // Save for detailed analysis
  await browser_pdf_save({ name: "research_paper_analysis" });
  
  // Extract key findings
  const keyFindings = await browser_extract({
    instruction: "Extract the most important findings, performance metrics, and implementation insights from this research"
  });
  
  return { paperStructure, keyFindings };
};
```

### Content Validation and Verification

#### Cross-Source Validation
```javascript
// Validate information across multiple sources
const validateInformation = async (topic, sources) => {
  const validations = [];
  
  for (const source of sources) {
    await browser_navigate({ url: source });
    const information = await browser_extract({
      instruction: `Extract information about ${topic} and note the source credibility and publication date`
    });
    
    validations.push({
      source: source,
      information: information,
      credibility: assessCredibility(source),
      recency: assessRecency(information)
    });
  }
  
  return crossValidateInformation(validations);
};
```

#### Implementation Example Extraction
```javascript
// Extract practical implementation examples
const extractImplementationExamples = async (documentationUrl) => {
  await browser_navigate({ url: documentationUrl });
  
  const examples = await browser_extract({
    instruction: "Extract all code examples, implementation patterns, and practical usage examples from this documentation"
  });
  
  // Validate examples work with current APIs
  const validatedExamples = await validateExamples(examples);
  
  return validatedExamples;
};
```
