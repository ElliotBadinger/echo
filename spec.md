# Echo App - Specification for Future Improvements

This document outlines the planned improvements for the Echo app, focusing on UI/UX refinements and new feature development to elevate the app to a professional standard.

## 1. UI & UX Refinements

The current interface, while functional, requires significant polishing to improve usability, accessibility, and visual appeal.

### 1.1. Theme & Color System
- **Status Bar Integration:** The status bar will be made transparent to create a seamless, immersive user experience and eliminate the jarring "black bar" at the top of the screen.
- **Accessibility & Contrast:** The entire color palette will be audited and adjusted to ensure all text and interactive elements meet or exceed WCAG AA contrast ratios, making the app usable for people with visual impairments.

### 1.2. Typography
- **Establish a Type Scale:** A formal typography scale (e.g., Headline 1, Subtitle, Body, Caption, Button) will be defined and applied consistently throughout the app. This will create a clear visual hierarchy and improve readability.
- **Font Selection:** A modern, highly-legible font will be chosen and implemented to replace the default system font, giving the app a more distinct and professional identity.

### 1.3. Layout & Spacing
- **Save Clip Bottom Sheet:** The layout will be redesigned to be fully responsive, ensuring that no text or buttons are truncated on smaller screens. The vertical spacing will be adjusted to make all options, especially the "All memory" chip, clearly visible.
- **Settings Screen:** The layout will be refactored to prevent button text from being cut off. Margins and padding will be standardized across all cards and elements to create a more balanced and visually pleasing composition.

## 2. New Features

To expand the app's capabilities and make it a more powerful tool for users.

### 2.1. In-App File Management
- **Recordings List:** A new screen will be implemented to display a list of all saved recordings. Each entry will show the file name, duration, and date.
- **Playback & Deletion:** Users will be able to tap on a recording to play it back within the app and will have the ability to delete unwanted files.

### 2.2. Post-Processing
- **Audio Trimming:** A simple audio editor will be added to allow users to trim the beginning and end of their saved clips.
- **Volume Adjustment:** A feature to normalize or boost the volume of a recording will be included.

### 2.3. Transcription
- **Speech-to-Text:** Integration with a speech-to-text engine will be implemented to provide automated transcriptions of saved recordings, making the content searchable and more accessible.
